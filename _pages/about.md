Hi! I'm Erin, a sophomore at Mission San Jose High School in Fremont, California. I'm really interested in the intersection of computer science and biology — basically, how we can use code and data to understand living systems and solve problems in healthcare.

Right now, I'm a student researcher at [ASDRP](https://www.asdrp.org/) (Aspiring Scholars Directed Research Program), where I'm working on synthesizing and optimizing lipid nanoparticles for drug delivery. I've gotten pretty comfortable with lab equipment like centrifuges, speed vacs, and tip sonicators. Last summer, I also did a program at Stanford Pre-Collegiate where I studied biochemistry and worked on a project about CRISPR-Cas9 and gene editing.

On the CS side, I completed the [Inspirit AI](https://www.inspiritai.com/) Scholars program, where I built a machine learning model to detect and track vehicles in traffic. I'm also a publicity officer for the CS Club at my school and a board member of Women in STEM.

Outside of STEM, I play cello (I'm co-principal cellist in our school orchestra) and I sing — I actually got to perform a solo at Carnegie Hall after placing 3rd internationally in the American Protégé competition. I also volunteer weekly at [FCSN](https://fcsn1996.org/) teaching kids with developmental disabilities.

I started this blog to write about things I'm learning and thinking about, mostly related to science and the brain. Thanks for stopping by!
