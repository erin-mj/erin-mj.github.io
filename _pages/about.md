Hi! I'm Erin, a sophomore at Mission San Jose High School in Fremont, California. I'm really interested in the intersection of computer science and biology — basically, how we can use code and data to understand living systems and solve problems in healthcare.

Right now, I'm a student researcher at [ASDRP](https://www.asdrp.org/) (Aspiring Scholars Directed Research Program), where I'm working on synthesizing and optimizing lipid nanoparticles for drug delivery. Last summer, I also did a program at Stanford Pre-Collegiate where I studied biochemistry and worked on a project about CRISPR-Cas9 and gene editing.

I'm also interested in programming and machine learning. Outside of STEM, I'm into speech and debate — I compete in the Lincoln-Douglas debate format.

I started this blog to write about things I'm learning and thinking about, mostly related to science. Thanks for stopping by!
